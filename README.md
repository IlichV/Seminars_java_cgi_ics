# Seminars_java_cgi_ics
Java Web Scrapping with ics files and CGI script

This Java program does web scrapping with Jsoup library to transform data from a web page of seminars into a ICS file.

Also we use CGI script to run our program in our web server.
See the file conf of Apache2 to enable Cgi script in our server with .ics extension file.

(When tryin to run the app in linux make sure to give the files the correct permissions this can be done with ( sudo chmod 755 file.yourfile ).
